FRIDAY 072817
-figure out the callback url for C9
-solve why new trek is not displaying after creation
-index treks under the adventures in text-right main-column
-->index treks then possibly render the new trek form in place of the indexed treks
   only once the 'Add Trek' form is present then the treks will disappear

-creating a new trek from its own page returns the json of data, good but want to diaplay new trek on app instead
-also, new trek from same page after AJAX shows json of data
-figure out the drop-down menu part
-i don't think associations of advs are working if i take away the selection.
