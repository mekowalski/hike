# Hike App

Where I live I am given a variety of terrain to adventure on.  I am a few hours of driving to rock climb desert landscapes, raft mighty rivers.  In town I can hike, run, camp, swim nearly anywhere within a five mile radius.  This app was in though of logging all the adventures I can do within my surroundings.  Hike App is built on Rails framework with Ruby code.  Password confirmation Bcrypt gem is used to secure user information.  ActiveRecord associations and validations, ActionView helpers and Omniauth via Github are used to help build Hike App.
