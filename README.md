# Hike App

Where I live I am given a variety of terrain to adventure on.  I am a few hours of driving to rock climb desert landscapes, raft mighty rivers.  In town I can hike, run, camp, swim nearly anywhere within a five mile radius.  This app was in thought of logging all the adventures I can do within my surroundings.  Hike App is built on Rails framework with Ruby code.  This version of Hike App includes Javascript functions such as jQuery and AJAX functions to obtain ans showcase information in a seamless manner.  Begin logging your hikes now and don't forget the sunscreen, layers, snacks and water!
